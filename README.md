# spark-mongo-sqlserver-cluster-mode
Trying to run a join between MongoDB collection and tabular structure generated by using a SQL Server side tables join

Spark Cluster setup process has been broken down into two steps
1. Install all spark, python and other required binaries. This step creates a docker image with name: `apache-spark` 
    > docker build -t apache-spark ./
2. Docker-Compose uses image name `apache-spark` for building another docker image capable of starting spark in cluster mode. This step is going to create a docker image and start the cluster
    >docker-compose -p spark up --build

This newly built image will be named `image: cluster-apache-spark:3.1.2` as it's used in docker-compose.yml

Once we are all set for spark cluster, we can work on scala projects to submit jobs.
